## Technologies
hellotools is created with the following amazing technologies:
* WinUI: 2.8.0
* UWP: 6.2.12

## Version number
We use the current year, month, and day for the version number. This ensures that no version will overlap with a previous version. If we release two versions in one day a letter will be added to the end of the version string.
An example of this:
```
YEAR.MONTH.DAYb
2021.11.5b
```

## Project structure
We try to structure hellotools as simply as posible. All code and assets are located in the "HelloTools" folder. Assets are located in the Assets folder. source holds all of the code. features contains all of the "apps"/features.
```
HelloTools (Main folder)
- Assets (ex: app icons)
- Properties (Basic info for windows)
- source
  - features ("Lorem Ipsum", "Fake Info", etc)
```
